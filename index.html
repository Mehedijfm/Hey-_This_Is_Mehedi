                    <h3>HTML5</h3>
                    <p>html started its journey in 2008.  Html has been updated 5 times since the beginning.  This means that the html structure we currently use is the html5 version.
                    I have been working with html for a long time, I am committed to how to do a lot with less code.  I have been working on web design and development for the last 3 years.</p>

                    <p>Remember that house?  After building the house you can paint to make it look beautiful, you can put the doors and windows in the right place.  And this is what CSS does for your web page.  Then it is not like the house was built, just like the web page with HTML, but to make it beautiful, you must use CSS.</p>

That you built the house, painted everything, then what is left?  Do you take electricity in your house?  As soon as the switch is turned on, the fan starts turning.  These are some of the functional tasks that JavaScript does.</p>
